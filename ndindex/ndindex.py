    Represents an index into an nd-array (i.e., a numpy array).

    This is a base class for all ndindex types. All types that subclass this
    class should redefine the following methods

    - `_typecheck(self, *args)` should do type checking and basic type
      canonicalization, and either return a tuple of the new arguments for the
      class or raise an exception. Type checking means it should raise
      exceptions for input types that are never semantically meaningful for
      numpy arrays, for example, floating point indices, using the same
      exceptions as numpy where possible. Basic type canonicalization means,
      for instance, converting integers into `int` using `operator.index()`.
      All other canonicalization should be done in the `reduce()` method. The
      `NDIndex` base constructor will automatically set `.args` to the
      arguments returned by this method. Classes should always be able to
      recreate themselves with `.args`, i.e., `type(idx)(*idx.args) == idx`
      should always hold.

    - `raw` (a **@property** method) should return the raw index that can be
      passed as an index to a numpy array.

    In addition other methods should be defined as necessary.

    - `__len__` should return the largest possible shape of an axis sliced by
      the index (for single-axis indices), or raise ValueError if no such
      maximum exists.

    - `reduce(shape=None)` should reduce an index to an equivalent form for
      arrays of shape `shape`, or raise an IndexError. The error messages
      should match numpy as much as possible. The class of the equivalent
      index may be different. If `shape` is `None`, it should return a
      canonical form that is equivalent for all array shapes (assuming no
      IndexErrors).

    The methods `__init__`, `__eq__`, and `__hash__` should *not* be
    overridden. Equality (and hashability) on `NDIndex` subclasses is
    determined by equality of types and `.args`. Equivalent indices should not
    attempt to redefine equality. Rather they should define canonicalization
    via `reduce()`.

        same. To use it with slices with negative start or stop, call
        :meth:`reduce` with a shape first.

        `as_subindex` can be seen as the left-inverse of composition, that is,
        if `i = j[k]`, that is, `a[i] = a[j][k]`, then `k = i.as_subindex(j)`,
        so that `k "=" (j^-1)[i]` (this only works as a true inverse if
        `j` is a subset of `i`).

        Note that due to symmetry, `a[j][i.as_subindex(j)]` and
        `a[i][j.as_subindex(i)]` will give the same subarrays of `a`, which
        will be the array that includes the elements indexed by both `a[i]`
        and `a[j]`.

        `i.as_subindex(j)` may raise `ValueError` in the case that the indices
        `i` and `j` do not intersect at all.

        Examples
        ========

        An example usage of `as_subindex` is to split an index up into
        subindices of chunks of an array. For example, say a 1-D array `a` is
        chunked up into chunks of size `N`, so that `a[0:N]`, `a[N:2*N]`,
        `[2*N:3*N]`, etc. are stored separately. Then an index `a[i]` can be
        reindexed onto the chunks via `i.as_subindex(Slice(0, N))`,
        `i.as_subindex(Slice(N, 2*N))`, etc.
